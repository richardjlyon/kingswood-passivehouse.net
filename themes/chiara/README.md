# Chiara Ghost Theme

Thanks for purchasing Chiara. I hope you like. If you have a question, feel free to drop me note at me@svenread.com.

Dont forget to change the Google Analytics account to yours in this line of code, which can be found in default.hbs:

ga('create', 'UA-47305801-1', 'svenread.com');

Furthermore you should customize the content of the <head> tag to your needs.

Next you can add your social media accounts & custom links inside index.hbs.

I have added automatic Code Coloring via Highlight.js. You can choose your own theme (if you want to) via the CSS include in the <head> element
of the default.hbs (this is my default selection: <link rel="stylesheet" href="{{asset "js/styles/obsidian.css"}}">). Just choose a different theme from
the directory (/assets/js/styles) and enter the name into the above link.

If you give a post the tag "articleImage" it will get a big article header image with parallax scrolling and an awesome presence. This big header image
simply grabs the first image in your post and uses it as article header image. So please make sure if you use of this feature to choose an image
with an high enough resolution.

Additionally, you now have a custom about page template (example: http://www.svenread.com/about/. It gets used automatically if you create
a static page that has the URL "about" and nothing more. Again, this page grabs the first image in your content and uses it as big 
header image. So please choose an image worthy and capable of this big display.

Image alt tags will automatically get rendered as figcaptions beneath your image. Hurray!

In case you have any question, please let me know on me@svenread.com or @starburst1977.

Have fun.

bye Sven
